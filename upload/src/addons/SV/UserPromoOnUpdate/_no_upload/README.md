# XenForo2-UserPromoOnUpdate

Allows an Custom Fields to match an empty rule if selected.

Preforms a user promotion when:
- A user updates their own profile.
- When admin's edit a user's profile.
- A user upgrade is applied or removed

Adds an explicit "match none" option for custom fields, as stock XF has selected empty custom field matches any.
